#Full Stack Nanodegree Project 4: Concentration Game

## Set-Up Instructions:
1.  Update the value of application in app.yaml to the app ID you have registered
 in the App Engine admin console and would like to use to host your instance of this sample.
1.  Run the app with the devserver using dev_appserver.py DIR, and ensure it's
 running by visiting the API Explorer - by default localhost:8080/_ah/api/explorer.
1.  (Optional) Generate your client library(ies) with the endpoints tool.
 Deploy your application.
 
 
 
##Game Description:
Concentration game, which is also commonly known as card matching game, is a guessing game to match a pair of cards among a set of cards laid face down. Each game begins with a set of cards (often 52 is used as the standard), and a player can pick two cards to flip. If the flipped cards are a pair, then the pair remains face up, but if not, the two cards are flipped back. The game is won when all the cards are guessed correctly and face up. Maximum number of attempts can be set and if the player fails to flip all the cards within the limit, the game will be lost. For this app, only a single player plays the game and tries to reach a good score, which is defined by a ratio of how many attempts are left over how many attempts are allowed. 'Guesses' are sent to the `make_guess` endpoint which will reply with whether the guess was correct or not. If not, the endpoint will tell what the numbers of each cards are. Each game can be retrieved or played by using the path parameter
`urlsafe_game_key`.
